Raspberry Pi Thin Client setup 
These are just some files that I have created that might help you setup a raspberry pi thin client
I DID NOT CREATE THE checkrdesk.sh SCRIPT. I FOUND IT ONLINE. I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE I GOT IT FROM BUT BEWARE THAT IT ISN'T MINE. IF SOMEBODY COULD POINT ME TO THE CREATOR I WOULD GLADLY SOURCE HIM ON MY GITHUB.
