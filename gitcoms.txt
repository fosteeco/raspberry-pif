First thing you need to do is use the command "git init" to setup the folder you're working in 
Then you use "git add ." to setup the files in the folder for commit
Then "git commit -m "First Commit"
Now you need to connect to your github with "git remote add origin https://yourlink.git"
Then verify the url with "git remote -v" 
Now you can push the changes with "git push origin master"

Commands:
git init 
git add .
git commit -m "First Commit" 
git remote add origin https://yourlink.git
git remote -v 
git push origin master
